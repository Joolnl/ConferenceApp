#### Celebrate the Laravel Community 
Laracon EU hosts multiple annual conferences where the international Laravel PHP community celebrates together. It's an unforgettable experience where we meet with friends, network for business and gain opportunities while learning about modern web development.

This year we expect 850 attendees in Amsterdam for a three day event and up to 250 attendees in Madrid for a single day event. Both conferences have one primary stage with 30 min. sessions and will mainly focus on in-depth technical topics that are relevant for Laravel developers.
